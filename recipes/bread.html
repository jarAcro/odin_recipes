    <ul>
        <li>3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (about 110째F or 43째C)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional, for yeast activation)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong>
            <p>In a small bowl, combine the warm water and sugar (if using). Sprinkle the yeast over the water's surface. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy and bubbly. This indicates that the yeast is active and ready to use.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong>
            <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Pour in the activated yeast mixture. Stir until the dough comes together, and then knead it on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>First Rise:</strong>
            <p>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Loaf:</strong>
            <p>After the first rise, gently punch down the dough to release any air bubbles. Shape it into a round or oval loaf.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Second Rise:</strong>
            <p>Place the shaped dough on a baking sheet or in a greased loaf pan. Cover it again and let it rise for another 30 minutes to an hour.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Preheat and Score:</strong>
            <p>Preheat your oven to 425째F (220째C). If desired, make a few shallow slashes (score) on the surface of the dough using a sharp knife or razor blade. This allows the bread to expand and gives it an artisan look.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong>
            <p>Bake the bread in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until it's golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong>
            <p>Allow the bread to cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing. Serve slices warm with butter or your favorite spreads.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
